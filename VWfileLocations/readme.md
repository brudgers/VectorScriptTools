VWfileLocations is based on Vectorworks 2008.

Vectorworks uses integers to select both file paths as described in the documentation for [GetFolderPath]: http://developer.vectorworks.net/index.php?title=VS:GetFolderPath

The file: File locations-Assignment.txt defines each file path as a constant with a [hopefully] meaningful name.
