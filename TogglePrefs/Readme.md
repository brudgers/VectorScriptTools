<p>TogglePrefs is a VectorSript project for use with the CAD Porgram Vectorworks. It was current as of Vectorworks 2008, but should work with later versions.</p>

<p>At the top level there are icons from which commands can be run. Running commands from icons in Vectorworks requires clicking in the drawing screen because icons were only designed for use with tools and Vectorworks distinguishes between tools and commands. A soucrce of much disgust on my part and dogmatic  defense by Nemetschek staff and established Vectorworks programmers.</p>

<p>There are several examples of preference toogles implemented as tools and these include icons.</p>

<p>In addition, there is a complete collection of commands which were autogenerated from the HTML table on the VectorScript support site: 
http://developer.vectorworks.net/index.php?title=VS:Function_Reference_Appendix
  These commands live in the "Code files" directory.</p>

<p>Finally, there are tools for generating the code files including a master Excel file and VectorScript files for processing the output from the excel file.</p>
