VwMenuCommands contains **all** menu commands current as of VectorWorks 2008. It is based upon the documentation found in [Appendix H of the VS Function Reference](http://developer.vectorworks.net/index.php?title=VS:Function_Reference_Appendix#Appendix_H_-_DoMenuTextByName_Constants)

The Master Tools contains:
1. MS Office tools for mail merging a spreadsheet into the a Microsoft Word template to generate the entire list of commands.
2. VectorScripts for processing the output into individual files.

Originally, I captured the content as HTML from the VS Function Reference by copying and pasting the table. That should still work for anyone interested in updating the repository.
