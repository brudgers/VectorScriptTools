VwIrritate was written when I was concerned about getting people to buy various VectorWorks tools - it's a sort of DRM for demo versions. The whole concept of making money on retail sales of Vectorworks utilities is of course absurd for most people, and beyond absurd if like I was doing at the time, you go out of your way to piss off potential customers.

Anyway, it is current as of VW 2008, but might not work with later versions of Vectorworks if the undocumented feature of returing the date in US format has been changed - not necessarily something I would bet on, however.

Enjoy the irritation!
