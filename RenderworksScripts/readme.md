<p>RenderworksScripts was written for Vectorworks 2008. It was written based upon the Vectorscript referece: </p>

<p>http://developer.vectorworks.net/index.php?title=VS:Function_Reference_Appendix </p>

<p>Some of the commands require Renderworks. Others manipulate the standard drawing modes.</p>

<p>Originally, there was some divergence between the documentation of the chunk Parameters and the actual implementation in Vectorworks 2008. So be aware that there may be minor difference between the official documentation and the current [or past] version of Vectorworks.</p>

<p>As Always, if you choose to implement the commands by wrapping them into a tool and calling them from an icon, a click in the drawing window will be required to exectute the command after clicking on its icon.</p>

<p>RenderworksScripts contains:</p>
<li>Parameter Scripts for switching Renderworks modes</li>
<li>Parameter Scripts for setting Renderworks modes</li>
<li>Icons for representing Renderworks modes as tools</li>
